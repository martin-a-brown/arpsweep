  * internal release

2006-05-01 0.45   Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>

  * switched to using doubly linked lists; very convenient,
    but performance stinks > 1000 IPs (see TODO)
  * accept IP addrs on STDIN
  * accept MAC addrs on command line or STDIN (per manpage)
  * moved linked list code to file list.c
  * added README and very basic INSTALL

  * allow user to select output format for MAC address
  * accept multiple input formats for MAC address
  * pass format as an option to ln_ether_ntoa
  * better o.wait / o.waittv math

2006-04-30 0.43   Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>

  * stopped believing h->ts in pcap_handler, I'm in good company.
    sadly, time calculations will probably be a bit off, then
  * switched to snprintf, changed prototype for ln_ether_ntoa
  * Alpha release of code; configure script badly borked
  * PCAP (or BPF) doesn't work on OpenBSD+Darwin (see TODO)
  * added THANKS file (and even some thanks)

  * added timeval calculations functions in timevalmath.h
  * able to calculate round-trip times!
  * separated all #defines to defines.h
  * added select() functionality, error reporting for select()
  * tried singly linked lists for data storage (arp_record struct)
  * linked list debugging added
  * moved option validation to separate function

2006-04-25 0.41   Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>

  * added more sophisticated logging, verbosity and debugging system
  * toyed with linked lists (with only one member, huh?)
  * added function for transmitting ARP frames
  * moved pcap initialization to own function

2006-04-21 0.2    Martin A. Brown <martin@linux-ip.net>

  * added command line processing, usage functions
  * added arp_record struct
