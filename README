arpsweep README
===============
The arpsweep utility is a reimplementation of arping which supports multiple
targets in a single command-line invocation.  It can also be used as an ARP
network scanner.


arpsweep Q&A
============

Q: What is ARP?
A: Address Resolution Protocol.  Are you sure you are in the right place?

Q: What does an ARP request and reply look like.
A: Included in this distribution are a sample pcap file (arp-example.pcap
   and a shell script which prints out that very same data.  This will
   show an ARP request and an ARP reply.  See also README.arpframes.

Q: Why do I need this utility?
A: If you are asking this question, you probably don't.

Q: How do I install the program?
A: Like most other software (./configure && make), for details see INSTALL.

Q: What's an example of how to run the program?
A: arpsweep -i eth0 10.10.20.2 10.10.20.1 10.10.20.7

Q: How else can I run it?
A: See the manpage.  (If arpsweep is not yet installed, you should be
   able to view the manpage by running this command: "man ./arpsweep.8".)

Q: How fast is arpsweep?
A: Fairly fast, although it wasn't designed to be speedy.  On a low-end
   workstation-class machine, compare the following stats with a varying
   inflight packet count (--pending) and the resulting duration of scan
   (according to "time").  Each run used the default count (--count) of
   packets, 3.

     address range (count)    inflight  arpsweep run time
     -----------------------  --------  -------------------------
     class C, /24 (256 ** 1)      100      2.08 seconds 
     class C, /24 (256 ** 1)     1000      0.77 seconds 

     class B, /16 (256 ** 2)     1000     49.5  seconds 
     class B, /16 (256 ** 2)    10000      5.5  seconds

     class A,  /8 (256 ** 3)    10000   2052.   seconds (~35 min)
     class A,  /8 (256 ** 3)   100000   2086.   seconds (~35 min)

   Performance is surprisingly good, although memory consumption is fairly
   high (~900M resident) when scanning an entire class A network.  If you
   really need to send a pile of ARP in a heck of a hurry, use Bobrowski's
   arpscan.
