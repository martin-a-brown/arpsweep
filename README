The arpsweep utility is a reimplementation of arping which supports multiple
targets in a single command-line invocation.  It can also be used as an ARP
network scanner.


arpsweep Q&A
============

Q: What is ARP?
A: Address Resolution Protocol.  Are you sure you are in the right place?

Q: What does an ARP request and reply look like.
A: Included in this distribution are a sample pcap file (arp-example.pcap
   and a shell script which prints out that very same data.  This will
   show an ARP request and an ARP reply.  See also README.arpframes.

Q: Why do I need this utility?
A: If you are asking this question, you probably don't.

Q: How do I install the program?
A: Like most other software, for details see INSTALL.

Q: What's an example of how to run the program?
A: arpsweep -i eth0 10.10.20.2 10.10.20.1 10.10.20.7

Q: How else can I run it?
A: See the manpage.  (If arpsweep is not yet installed, you should be
   able to view the manpage by running this command: "man ./arpsweep.8".)
