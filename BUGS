=============

See also TODO.

  - Occasionally, "Floating point exception", when SIGINT sent.
  - Cisco formatted MAC supplied like this: 0080.c8fb.78-d8 appears
    to be scanned correctly (according to sscanf), but the address
    stored in memory is not correct.  I'd prefer to have sscanf fail.
