The arpsweep utility was conceived to solve a problem Dale Carder had in a
wireless captive portal network [0].  I would never have started to create
this utility without having heard of his problem.  Without firing off dozens
of arping children and capturing their exit codes, how can you discover if
hosts are still alive on the network?

I have used many open source projects as models for the software and have
taken suggestions from many people.  Here is a list of people and projects to
whom this utility owes its existence.
